# wrangling-and-visualizing-musical-data

## Project Description

#### The project assumes familiarity with standard tidyverse tools for R, particularly tibble data structure and the dplyr and ggplot2 packages. Musical knowledge may give you ideas to analyze and visualize musical datas; finding the most common chords and chord progressions in a sample of pop/rock music from 1950s-1990s, and able to compare the styles of different artists.

#### Parsed and cleaned version of the data set came from McGill Billboard Dataset version 2.0 (CCO License)
